# Corner Grocer – Item Tracking Application

## Overview
Corner Grocer is a C++ console application designed to track and analyze items purchased throughout a business day. The program processes an input file containing item names and generates frequency-based insights while maintaining a backup record of all processed data.

This project demonstrates foundational programming concepts including file input/output, data aggregation, and menu-driven user interaction.

## Features
- Read item purchase data from an input file
- Count frequency of each item purchased
- Display item purchase totals to the user
- Generate a backup file storing item frequency data
- Menu-driven interface for user interaction

## Technologies Used
- **C++**
- **File I/O**
- **Standard Template Library (STL)**
- **Command-line interface design**

## Program Workflow
1. User provides an input file containing purchased items
2. Program processes and counts item occurrences
3. Results are displayed through menu options
4. A backup file is generated to store processed data
5. User can view results or exit the application

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Data processing using file input streams
- Basic analytics through frequency counting
- CLI menu design and user input handling
- Backup data generation for persistence
- Clean separation of program flow and logic
